# SOLID Principles & Clean Code Review

## Overview
This document provides a detailed review of how the Shaadi Mantra codebase adheres to SOLID principles and clean code practices, with concrete examples and recommendations for further improvement.

---

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Controllers** (e.g., `authController.js`, `profileController.js`, `uploadController.js`, `invitationController.js`) are focused on handling HTTP requests, validation, and responses for a specific domain.
- **Validation, security, and utility logic** is extracted into separate utility objects/classes (e.g., `SecurityUtils`, `ProfileValidationUtils`, `UploadValidationUtils`, `InvitationValidationUtils`).
- **Error handling** is centralized in `utils/errors.js` with custom error classes.

**Example:**
- `SecurityUtils` handles all input validation, sanitization, and rate limiting, keeping controllers focused on business logic.

---

## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **Controllers and services** are designed to be extended (e.g., MongoDB vs. static mode) without modifying core logic. The `config/controllers.js` file dynamically selects which controller to use based on environment/config.
- **Validation utilities** are extensible with new rules and patterns.

**Example:**
- Switching between static/mock and MongoDB implementations is done via configuration, not by changing controller code.

---

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **Controller interfaces** (e.g., for auth, profile, invitation) are consistent between static and MongoDB implementations, so swapping implementations does not break the API contract.

**Example:**
- Both `authController.js` and `authControllerMongo.js` expose the same methods and expected request/response structure.

---

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **Utilities and services** expose focused, granular methods (e.g., `validateEmail`, `sanitizeInput`, `validateProfileId`, `validateFileType`), so consumers only use what they need.
- **Controllers** do not force unrelated dependencies or methods on consumers.

**Example:**
- `ProfileValidationUtils` provides only profile-related validation methods, not unrelated logic.

---

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- **Controllers depend on abstractions** (e.g., services, utils) rather than concrete implementations. For example, email sending, data source, and session management are injected or required as services/utilities.
- **Configurable data source:** The backend can switch between static/mock and MongoDB by changing config, not controller code.

**Example:**
- `emailService`, `dataSourceService`, and `preApprovedEmailService` are injected as dependencies, not hardcoded.

---

## Clean Code Practices
- **Comprehensive input validation** and sanitization everywhere (prevents injection, XSS, and bad data).
- **Consistent error handling** with structured error responses and codes.
- **Rate limiting** and security checks are modular and reusable.
- **Clear separation of concerns:** business logic, validation, and request handling are not mixed.
- **Descriptive variable and function names** (e.g., `validateProfileUpdate`, `checkRateLimit`, `storeOTP`).
- **Extensive comments and documentation** in code and markdown files.
- **No code duplication:** shared logic is factored into utilities.
- **Environment/config-driven behavior** (static/dev/prod, feature flags).

---

## Areas for Further Improvement
- **TypeScript adoption** in backend would further enforce contracts and interfaces.
- **Service layer** could be formalized (e.g., using classes/interfaces for all business logic).
- **Dependency injection** frameworks could be used for even more decoupling.
- **Automated tests** (unit/integration) could be more visible in the codebase for CI/CD.

---

## Summary
Your codebase demonstrates strong adherence to SOLID and clean code principles:
- **Controllers are focused, modular, and environment-agnostic.**
- **Validation, security, and error handling are centralized and reusable.**
- **The system is extensible, maintainable, and easy to reason about.**
