Backblaze B2 offers a very generous free tier, but it’s important to know its limits to estimate when you might start incurring charges.

🎁 Backblaze B2 Free Tier (as of 2025)

Resource	Monthly Free Allowance
Storage	10 GB
Download (egress)	1 GB per day (~30 GB/month)
Class B Transactions	2,500/day (~75,000/month)
Class C Transactions	2,500/day (~75,000/month)
Note: Beyond these limits, you're charged per GB or per transaction.

📊 From Your Billing Snapshot

Between May 29, 2025 – July 29, 2025, your usage is:

Storage: $0.00 — indicates <10 GB stored
Bandwidth: $0.00 — likely <30 GB/month
API calls (list/create): Minimal
Transactions (Class B & C): $0.00 — so <75,000/month
📈 When Might You Hit the Limit?

Let’s assume each profile picture is ~300 KB (compressed JPEG).

1. Storage Usage Estimate
# of Pictures	Size Each	Total	Status
100 users	300 KB	30 MB	Safe
1,000 users	300 KB	300 MB	Still Safe
30,000 users	300 KB	~9 GB	Near Limit
35,000 users	300 KB	~10.5 GB	Exceeds Free Tier 🚨
✅ You can support ~30,000 active users uploading 1 photo each before exceeding the 10 GB free storage limit.
2. Download Bandwidth Estimate
If each user downloads their profile pic once/day (e.g., page load):

Daily Downloads	Data Served/day	Monthly Bandwidth
100	~30 MB	~900 MB
500	~150 MB	~4.5 GB 🚨
1,000+	~300 MB+	~9+ GB
✅ You can support ~100–300 daily active downloads without exceeding the 1 GB/day (30 GB/month) free bandwidth.
🚨 When You'll Likely Exceed Free Tier

Around 30,000 stored profile images (assuming no old versions kept)
Or 300+ daily downloads of profile pictures
Or heavy use of listing/metadata operations (though these are still cheap)
💰 Post-Free Pricing (2025)

Resource	Price (USD)
Storage	$0.005/GB/month
Download (egress)	$0.01/GB
Class B TX	$0.004/1,000 calls
Class C TX	$0.004/1,000 calls
Example: Exceeding 10 GB storage by 5 GB = $0.025/month

✅ Tips to Stay Within Free Tier

🧹 Enable lifecycle rules: Keep only latest version of image
🖼 Compress images (under 300 KB ideally)
🧮 Cache profile pictures on your server/CDN to avoid daily downloads
🧑‍💻 Limit API calls (batch operations when possible)
